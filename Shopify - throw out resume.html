<h1 id="toc_0">Throw out Resume</h1>

<h3 id="toc_1">Overview</h3>

<p>The idea I worked on is Throw out Resume. It is a step-by-step program to help graduates apply jobs. Though it is called &quot;Throw out Resume&quot;, I think the program still need to ask applicants basic information but graduates do not need to worry about their resumes‘ format and organization. </p>

<p>Personally, I think this program should provide the following functions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provide recent available jobs</li>
<li>Graduates could found out companies’ overview</li>
<li>They could complete their &quot;resumes&quot;</li>
<li>Socialize with companies</li>
<li>Send resumes the system generated and get notifications</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on those functions, I designed a simple <strong>IOS UI</strong> for this application. It would give a better understanding.</p>

<p>There are four bottom buttons (<strong>Jobs</strong>, <strong>Connect</strong>, <strong>Companies</strong> and <strong>Me</strong>) that switch to different interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Jobs</h2>

<h3 id="toc_3">HOW?</h3>

<p><img src="/Users/amyzhu/Desktop/shopify/3.png" alt="MacDown logo"></p>

<p>After graduates register their accounts. They set up basic information and store it on <strong>Me</strong>. The application would ask for what kind of jobs graduates want to find, and generate mapped jobs on <strong>Jobs</strong>. They can also search from the top by typing the format <em>Job, Location</em>. For example, Software Developer, Waterloo.</p>

<p>If the graduate has interests on one job, and he/she click on that job. The job will be already read, and the blue circle will disappear. The graduate can click the top <em>refresh</em> button for getting newest jobs the application has.</p>

<p>If the graduate clicks on one job, it will lead to another page which provide detailed information the job actually about.</p>

<p>He/she can click the top <em>add</em> button to send his/her resume, or modify his/her cover letter and resume and jump to <strong>Me</strong>.</p>

<p>If he/she wants to know more about the company (the example company is Shopify), they can just click on company which would lead to another interface, <strong>Companies</strong>. I will talk on that later.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">WHY?</h3>

<p>This interface is important since it provides the following benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Updates the newest information</li>
<li>Easy to apply an appropriate job</li>
<li>View companies&#39; review in one application</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, based on my design, it is user-friendly since applicants only need two pages to apply one job.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">IMPLEMENT?</h3>

<p>My brief idea to implement this interface is through Master-detailed flow. The master page is all jobs with simplified information such as which company is, where the job is and what kind of jobs. The detailed page is the page provides detailed information.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Connect</h2>

<h3 id="toc_7">HOW?</h3>

<p><img src="/Users/amyzhu/Desktop/shopify/4.png" alt="MacDown logo"></p>

<p>The <strong>Connect</strong> interface is obvious and simple. The basic function for that is to communicate with representatives of each company. I think many applications develop the same function.</p>

<p>Graduates could find representatives&#39; accounts through <strong>Companies</strong> interface. They can just click the representatives and ask them questions about companies. If the companies have interests on applicants, they can communicate applicants as well.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">WHY?</h3>

<p>Most of programs for applying jobs are lack of connections between applicants and companies. I feel it is inconvenient to communicate with HRs. I should always look through the whole information about one job and find out representatives&#39; email or phone number. Therefore, I think it it important to connect companies and applicants.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">IMPLEMENT?</h3>

<p>I do not have experience on developing a chat application. However, I search from the Internet and I found out there are several widgets available to implement this function.</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">Companies</h2>

<h3 id="toc_11">HOW?</h3>

<p><img src="/Users/amyzhu/Desktop/shopify/5.png" alt="MacDown logo"></p>

<p>Recall from <strong>Jobs</strong> and <strong>Connect</strong> interface, the <strong>Companies</strong> interface is significant. On <strong>Jobs</strong>, graduates could click on one Company (the above example is Shopify), and see the overview of the company.</p>

<p>The main page is a list of companies the applicants are interested. Applicants get updated notifications of companies on their <strong>Jobs</strong> interface.</p>

<p>It is also convenient for graduates to search a company if they have a long list since there is a search function on the top of the main page.</p>

<p>If graduates want to have a new company notification, they can click <em>Add Companies</em>, there is another search function which search a new company that graduates do not add up yet. Then they can add the company and get notifications. The picture shows Shopify example.</p>

<p>How to see a company&#39;s information? Just click on the company that graduates want to see, it jump to the third page on the picture. It shows <em>Review, Salaries, Interviews, and Benefits</em> information. People who get jobs from that company could write an evaluation of the company.</p>

<p>Remember from <strong>Connect</strong> interface, an applicant can communicate with HRs directly. How could an applicant gets contact information of HRs? They could click <em>Leave Messages</em> of the company, and there will be a list of representatives.</p>

<p>Another question is one company might provide different fields of jobs available. If a graduate subscribes one company, but get notifications that they do not want is annoying. Therefore, applicants could select the field they want to get notified from <em>Job notification</em> button.</p>

<p>If the graduate does not have interest on that company, he/she can activate <em>Not notified</em> to unsubscribe that company. </p>

<h3 id="toc_12">WHY?</h3>

<p>This part improves and completes other interfaces, for example, socializing with representatives of companies.</p>

<p>Graduates could see companies&#39; information including <em>Review, Salaries, Interviews, and Benefits</em> directly. </p>

<p>It avoids graduates blindly sending their resumes to those companies they do not like. It saves time for both companies and graduates.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">IMPLEMENT?</h3>

<p>Personally I think it still need a master-detailed flow. The master page gives a list of companies, and the detailed page gives the overview information of companies. </p>

<p>However, since one graduate might have a number of companies. I think we should store all companies&#39; data in our database instead our code.</p>

<h2 id="toc_14">Me</h2>

<h3 id="toc_15">HOW?</h3>

<p><img src="/Users/amyzhu/Desktop/shopify/6.png" alt="MacDown logo"></p>

<p>Since our application is called &quot;Throw out resume&quot;, we should generate a resume for graduates. Here we asked their basic information.</p>

<p>It appears another master-detailed flow. The master page is the overview of applicants&#39; accounts. The application will ask graduates their basic information when they use our application at the first time. The information include what their names are, and what kind of jobs they want to find. Graduates could set up their accounts&#39; pictures later.</p>

<p>The second button <em>Jobs Applied</em> will give all job information an applicant applied. It is very similar to the <strong>Jobs</strong> interface.</p>

<p>Next following parts allow graduates to modify and change their detailed information including <em>cover letter, skills, education, rewards, and Work Experience</em>. If they have additional information want to add, they can click <em>Additional</em> to add other information they want to tell companies.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, the application itself will generate resumes for graduates. Graduates do not need to worry about resumes&#39; format and organization.</p>

<p>There is another button called <em>Settings</em>, graduates could allow other companies to see their information. If those companies have interested on one graduate, they can also <strong>Connect</strong> with the graduate.</p>

<p><em>Log out</em> button is obvious. The user could log out and change to another account.</p>

<h3 id="toc_16">WHY?</h3>

<p>This is the core part for graduates to set up their &quot;resumes&quot;. It helps graduates to recognize what kind of information companies want to know. It also complete other interfaces. <em>Settings</em> allows companies to see graduates&#39; information and graduates will definitely get more job opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="toc_17">IMPLEMENT?</h3>

<p>It is another master-detailed flow. The server also should have a database to store all applicants&#39; information.</p>

<h2 id="toc_18">Overall</h2>

<p>I think MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern should be good for this application since it updates information, and separates each parts clearly.</p>

<p>The above part is for graduates, and how could help them find available jobs quickly. However, our application have two types of users. Another type is companies&#39; users. Here I will give a brief idea for designing.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It should also have four interfaces, which keeps our application looks consistent. </li>
<li>The first interface is applicants&#39; resumes. Recall from <strong>Jobs</strong>, applicants send their resumes to companies they are interested.</li>
<li>The second interface remains the same for connecting HRs and graduates.</li>
<li>Remember, some applicants allow companies to see their information. Therefore, our third interface should be basic information of those applicants who meet companies&#39; requirements.</li>
<li>The last part allows companies to change and manage their information.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you like my design and want to see a complete explanation for companies&#39; users or if you have any questions about my design. Please email me to <a href="mailto:zhuzefang12@gmail.com">zhuzefang12@gmail.com</a>. I am very glad to talk with you.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway, thank you for giving me such opportunity!</strong></p>
